Dataset loading to ensure the credit card fraud dataset available

ðŸ”· Pipeline Workflow
1. Data Loading

- Load dataset: sampledcreditcard.csv

- Print shape & class distribution to confirm the safe loading.

2. Data Preprocessing

- Convert Time (seconds since first transaction) into timestamp relative to start.

- Engineer a new categorical feature: PartOfDay (morning, afternoon, evening, night) based on Time.

- Ensure Amount is numeric and scaled.

3. Feature Engineering

- Add the PartOfDay feature (one-hot encoded).

- Drop or keep original Time as needed.

4. Scaling & Encoding

- Standardize numeric features (Amount, V1â€“V28)

- Encode categorical PartOfDay via one-hot.

5. Feature Selection

- Train a RandomForest on full training data to rank feature importances.

- Keep top N most important features (including PartOfDay_* if important).

6. Train-Test Split

- Stratified split into train/test sets.

7. Handle Class Imbalance

- Apply SMOTE on training set only.

8. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning

- Train & evaluate multiple models (LogisticRegression, RandomForest, DecisionTree, XGBoost)

- Tune hyperparameters (optional â€” grid search).

9. Model Evaluation & Selection

- Compare models on ROC AUC & F1-score.

- Pick the best model.

10. Save Artifacts

- Save best model (joblib)

- Save scaler, selected_features, and encoder for deployment.

11. Deployment Readiness

- Artifacts can be loaded in production & used on new transactions.
